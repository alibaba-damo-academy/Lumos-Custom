To bridge the gap between generative flexibility and physical correctness, we propose **UniLumos**, a unified relighting framework for both images and videos that brings RGB-space geometry feedback into a flow-matching backbone.

<details><summary>Click for the abstract of UniLumos</summary>
> Relighting is a crucial task with both practical demand and artistic value, and recent diffusion models have shown strong potential by enabling rich and controllable lighting effects. 
However, as they are typically optimized in semantic latent space, where proximity does not guarantee physical correctness in visual space, they often produce unrealistic results‚Äîsuch as overexposed highlights, misaligned shadows, and incorrect occlusions. 
We address this with UniLumos, a unified relighting framework for both images and videos that brings RGB-space geometry feedback into a flow-matching backbone. 
By supervising the model with depth and normal maps extracted from its outputs, we explicitly align lighting effects with the scene structure, enhancing physical plausibility.
Nevertheless, this feedback requires high-quality outputs for supervision in visual space, making standard multi-step denoising computationally expensive. To mitigate this, we employ path consistency learning, allowing supervision to remain effective even under few-step training regimes. 
To enable fine-grained relighting control and supervision, we design a structured six-dimensional annotation protocol capturing core illumination attributes.  
Building upon this, we propose LumosBench, a disentangled attribute-level benchmark that evaluates lighting controllability via large vision-language models, enabling automatic and interpretable assessment of relighting precision across individual dimensions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniLumos achieves state-of-the-art relighting quality with significantly improved physical consistency, while delivering a 20x speedup for both image and video relighting.

## üöÄ Method Overview

### Pipeline
<div align="center">
    <img src='UniLumos/assets/pipline.jpg'/>
</div>

The overall pipeline of UniLumos. The left is LumosData, our proposed data construction pipeline, which consists of four stages for generating diverse relighting pairs from real-world sources. The right shows the architecture of UniLumos, a unified framework for image and video relighting, designed to achieve physically plausible illumination control.

### LumosBench

To evaluate the fine-grained controllability of lighting generation, we introduce **LumosBench**, a structured benchmark that targets six core illumination attributes defined in our annotation protocol. Our benchmark evaluates the performance of video relighting models from two key perspectives: qualitative alignment with user prompts and quantitative measurement of physical lighting properties. More details can be found in [LumosBench](UniLumos/LumosBench/readme.md).

> Relighting with captions, foreground videos, and background videos
```bash
# relighting with captions, foreground videos, and background videos
python unilumos_infer_abc.py
```
> Relighting with captions and foreground videos
```bash
# relighting with captions and foreground videos
python unilumos_infer_ab.py
```

> Relighting with captions and background videos
```bash
# relighting with captions and foreground videos
python unilumos_infer_ac.py
```

> Relighting only with captions
```bash
# relighting with captions and foreground videos
python unilumos_infer_a.py
```

- see in UniLumos/UniLumos/run_infer.sh for more details.
- you can change the number of sample_steps and sample_shift to control the quality and speed of the generated video.

### Perform image relighting

```bash
# here --image_size is (768, 512), --num_frames is 1
python unilumos_infer_image.py
```

### Perform LumosBench evaluation

See in LumosBench/readme.md for more details.
```bash
# there are many steps to run the evaluation, you can see in LumosBench/readme.md.
python main.py
```

### Baseline Video Relighting
